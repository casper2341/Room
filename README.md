# Room

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Android application that utilizes Room, Coroutines, and RecyclerView to display a list of employees.
This application is designed to demonstrate the use of Room for database management, Coroutines for background tasks and thread management, and RecyclerView for displaying data in a scrollable list.

## Features 

The application allows users to view a list of employees, add new employees, and edit or delete existing employees. The employee data is stored in a local SQLite database and is accessed using Room. Coroutines are used to perform database operations in the background, allowing the UI to remain responsive. RecyclerView is used to display the list of employees, with each employee represented by a card.
